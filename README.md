# 🚀 Day 05 – Java: Interfaces & Polymorphism

Welcome to Day 05 of Java learning!  
This repository contains hands-on examples and mini-projects demonstrating core Object-Oriented Programming concepts: **Interfaces**, **Multiple Inheritance via Interfaces**, and **Polymorphism** in Java.

---

## 📚 Topics Covered

### ✅ Interfaces in Java
- Declaring and implementing interfaces
- Achieving abstraction
- Interface method implementation in concrete classes

### ✅ Polymorphism
- Runtime polymorphism using interfaces
- Interface references pointing to different class objects
- Dynamic method dispatch

### ✅ Multiple Interface Implementation
- Java's way to support multiple inheritance using interfaces
- Resolving method name conflicts

## 📁 Project Structure

| File                          | Description |
|-------------------------------|-------------|
| `interfaces.java`             | Basic interface definition and implementation example |
| `InterfaceExample.java`       | Demonstrates polymorphism via interface references |
| `InterfaceMultipleExample.java` | Multiple interfaces implemented in one class |
| `InterfaceDemo.java`          | Real-world style demo using interfaces and dynamic dispatch |

## 🛠️ How to Run

1. Clone the repo:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Shank312/D-Day-05-Java-Interfaces-Polymorphism.git

Navigate to the folder:
cd D-Day-05-Java-Interfaces-Polymorphism

Compile and run using terminal or any Java IDE like IntelliJ/Eclipse:
javac interfaces.java
java interfaces

⚠️ Compile other files similarly before running based on the class with main() method.


🎯 Learning Objective
By the end of this project, you should be able to:

Understand how interfaces enforce abstraction

Achieve loose coupling using polymorphism

Handle multiple interface implementation

Build scalable Java applications using interface-based design
